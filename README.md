# web-scraping-challenge


Welcome to my submission for the Web Scraping Challenge in module 11 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in in basic HTML, web scraping techniques, and using BeautifulSoup.


# Challenge Description
In this challenge, we utilized web scraping techniques using tools like Beautiful Soup and Pandas to extract data from a provided website. The objective was to gather insights into Mars weather patterns and explore data from space missions. Through data analysis and visualization, we aimed to understand trends in Martian weather conditions and identify key factors influencing atmospheric pressure and temperature. Despite facing challenges in parsing HTML elements and handling missing data, we successfully extracted and analyzed the dataset. This project underscores the importance of web scraping in accessing real-time data for scientific research.
